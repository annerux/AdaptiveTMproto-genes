The R script "FigurePanels" reproducing most figures in Vakirlis et al
This script uses the supplementary data files also uploaded here - 
If you would like to see the scripts for image analysis and fitness estimations, go to: https://github.com/bbhsu/protogene-analysis 
If you would like to see the scripts for the synteny analyses that were part of the definition of emerging ORFs, go to: https://github.com/oacar/synal
The other R scripts were used internally to generate the supplementary data files (you cannot run them but feel free to inspect them).
The folder YBR196C-A_files contains the files used to analyze the evolutionary trajectory of the YBR196C-A ORF.
